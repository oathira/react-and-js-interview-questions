1.Find max occuring char

// Given a sentence, find the character that occurs the most frequently
// This solution is case-sensitive and counts spaces as characters
// It can be modified to ignore spaces or be case-insensitive if needed
//First method using nested loops
let string ="This is JavaScript interview question";
let maxChar = '';   
let maxCount = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let j = 0; j < string.length; j++) {
        if (string[i] === string[j]) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    if (count > maxCount) {
        maxCount = count;
        maxChar = string[i];
    }
}
console.log(`Max occurring character is "${maxChar}" with count ${maxCount}`); // Output: Max occurring character is "i" with count 4



-------------------------------------------------------------------


//Second method using a single loop
let string = "This is JavaScript interview question";
let out = {};

// Count occurrences of each character (ignoring spaces)
for (let ch of string) {
  if (ch !== " ") {
    out[ch] = (out[ch] || 0) + 1;
  }
}

// Find the character with maximum frequency
let maxChar = "";
let maxCount = 0;

for (let key in out) {
  if (out[key] > maxCount) {
    maxCount = out[key];
    maxChar = key;
  }
}

console.log(`Most frequent character: '${maxChar}' (appears ${maxCount} times)`);
// Output: Most frequent character: 'i' (appears 4 times)
// This method uses a single loop to count occurrences and another loop to find the max, making it efficient and straightforward.
