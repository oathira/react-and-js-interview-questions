1.Find missing odd number in an array
// Given an array of odd numbers with a common difference, find the missing odd number
const arr1 = [5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17];
const commonDiff = 2;

for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length - 1; i++) {
  if ((arr1[i + 1] - arr1[i]) !== commonDiff) {
    console.log(arr1[i] + commonDiff); // Missing number
    break; // stop after finding the first missing
  }
}
//output: 13
